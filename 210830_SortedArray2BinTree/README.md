### Logical Reasoning:
> A watch, which loses time uniformly, was observed to be 5 minutes fast at 8.00 p.m. on Thursday.
> It was noticed to be 7 minutes slow at 8.00 a.m. on the subsequent Monday.
> When did the watch show the correct time ? Explanation needed.

* a) 7 a.m. Saturday
* b) 7 a.m. on Friday
* c) 10a.m. on Sunday
* d) 11 a.m. on Friday

#### Answer: **a)**
from thurs 8pm to monday 8am is: **84 hours**

find linear interpolation equation from +5mins to -7mins: 

**f(x) = kx + 5,  where f(0) = 5, f(84) = -7**

when f(84) solving for k: **k = -1/7**

**f(x) = -x/7 + 5**

find when clock is on time f(x) = 0, solve for x: 

0 = -x/7 + 5

**x = 35**

8.00 p.m. on Thursday + **35 hours** is **7 a.m. Saturday**
